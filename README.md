# Pentest Tools Catalogue

A comprehensive reference platform for penetration testing tools and technologies used by Vulnerability Assessment centers, pentesting experts, and related organizations across Europe.

This platform serves as a collective representation of common tools used in the field, building upon recommendations and tools being used by experts throughout Europe.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Tool Database**: Browse a curated collection of penetration testing tools
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter tools by category, platform, license, and maturity
- **Search Functionality**: Search tools by name, description, or tags
- **Detailed Tool Pages**: View comprehensive information about each tool including use cases, related tools, and links
- **GitHub Integration**: Live GitHub star counts with caching
- **Community-Driven**: Easy to contribute new tools or update existing ones via YAML files

## Tech Stack

- **Angular**: Modern SPA framework with standalone components
- **Angular Material**: UI component library with dark theme
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **YAML**: Human-readable data format for tool definitions
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting with CI/CD

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ and npm
- Angular CLI (installed globally or via npx)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Penetration-Testing-Tools.git
cd Penetration-Testing-Tools
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Convert YAML data to JSON:
```bash
npm run convert-yaml
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Auto-Updating Tools from GitHub

The project includes a utility script that can automatically update tool metadata from GitHub:

```bash
npm run update-tools
```

This script will:
- ✅ Fetch the latest star count from GitHub
- ✅ Update maintainers/authors from repository owner and top contributors
- ✅ Add missing descriptions, websites, and licenses from GitHub
- ✅ Respect GitHub API rate limits (1 second delay between requests)

**Note**: The script only updates tools that have a `github_repo` field. Tools without GitHub repositories will be skipped.

**Rate Limits**: The script uses the GitHub API without authentication, which has a rate limit of 60 requests per hour. For higher limits, you can set a `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here npm run update-tools
```

To get a GitHub token:
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate a new token with `public_repo` scope
3. Use it as shown above
