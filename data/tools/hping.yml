summary: Command-line oriented TCP/IP packet assembler/analyzer that can be used for network security testing.
description: |
  Hping is a command-line oriented TCP/IP packet assembler/analyzer. The interface is inspired to the ping(8) unix command, but hping isn't only able to send ICMP echo requests. It supports TCP, UPD, ICMP and RAW-IP protocols, has a traceroute mode, the ability to send files between a covered channel, and many other features. Hping is useful for network security testing, firewall testing, and network performance analysis.
