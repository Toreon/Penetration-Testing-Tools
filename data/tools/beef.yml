summary: Penetration testing tool that focuses on the web browser and exploits browser vulnerabilities.
description: |
  BeEF (The Browser Exploitation Framework) is a penetration testing tool that focuses on the web browser. BeEF is short for The Browser Exploitation Framework. It is a penetration testing tool that focuses on the web browser. Amid growing concerns about web-borne attacks against clients, including mobile clients, BeEF allows the professional penetration tester to assess the actual security posture of a target environment using client-side attack vectors. Unlike other security frameworks, BeEF looks past the hardened network perimeter and client system, and examines exploitability within the context of the one open door: the web browser.
