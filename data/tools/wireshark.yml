summary: Network protocol analyzer that lets you capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network.
description: |
  Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer, or an application that captures packets from a network connection, such as from your computer to your home office or the internet. Packet is the name given to a discrete unit of data in a typical Ethernet network. Wireshark is the most often-used packet sniffer in the world. Like any other packet sniffer, Wireshark does three things: Packet Capture, Filtering, and Visualization.
