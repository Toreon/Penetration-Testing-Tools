summary: Fast TCP/UDP tunnel over HTTP, secured via SSH that allows you to create secure tunnels for network pivoting.
description: |
  Chisel is a fast TCP/UDP tunnel over HTTP, secured via SSH. It's designed to allow you to create secure tunnels for network pivoting during penetration tests. Chisel is written in Go and provides a client-server architecture that allows you to tunnel traffic through firewalls and NAT devices. It's particularly useful for establishing reverse tunnels and accessing internal networks.
